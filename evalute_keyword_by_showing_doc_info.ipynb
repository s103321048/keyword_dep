    "Typhoon Surigae is to bring rain to the nation’s east coast and mountainous areas in central and southern Taiwan from Wednesday to Friday, the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) said yesterday.\n",
    "As of 2pm yesterday, the typhoon’s center was 1,170km southeast of Oluanpi (鵝鑾鼻), Taiwan’s southernmost tip. The radius of the storm was 280km, and it was moving northwest at 9kph, with a maximum wind speed of 198kph.\n",
    "The bureau forecasts that the storm would switch to a northerly direction when approaching the east coast of Luzon Island in the Philippines on Wednesday, CWB forecaster Lin Ding-yi (林定宜) said, adding that Surigae would then move northeast along the Bashi Channel.\n",
    "Chances of temporary showers would be high in Yilan, Hualien and Taitung counties, as well as in the mountainous areas of central and southern Taiwan, he said.\n",
    "Surigae was to maintain its strength yesterday and today, Lin said, adding that similarly strong typhoons in April occurred in 1997, 2003 and 2015.\n",
    "Typhoons usually occur from July to September, the bureau said.\n",
    "Residents on the northern, eastern and southern coasts as well as those in Penghu and Kinmen counties should be prepared for swells, Lin said.\n",
    "Peng Chi-ming (彭啟明), chief executive of WeatherRisk Explore Inc, yesterday wrote on Facebook that Surigae was at the peak of its strength, with lightning frequently occurring at its eye and convection at its circumfluence.\n",
    "If it made landfall at this strength, it might cause a major disaster, he said.\n",
    "However, it was a good sign that convective heat transfer in mountainous areas began to occur yesterday afternoon, Peng said.\n",
    "“Convective heat transfer usually occurs on the west coast in April, but this year, it did not occur until yesterday,” he said.\n",
    "Thermal instability in the mountains of southern Taiwan were influenced by the typhoon, he added.\n",
    "CWB Director-General Cheng Ming-dean (鄭明典) said that Surigae has a double eyewall, which is generally a feature of strong typhoons, indicating that the storm might grow further before reaching Luzon.\n",
    "However, Surigae would gradually weaken once it is moving away from Luzon, Cheng said, citing conditions unfavorable for the typhoon.\n",
    "WeatherRisk analyst Wu Sheng-yu (吳聖宇) wrote on Facebook that Surigae would likely remain east of the Philippines for at least three to four days, and then accelerate its northward motion.\n",
    "“When the westerly trough abates, Surigae could also bring rain from southeast China. This might be the best opportunity we have for rain since the beginning of this month. If rain does not occur this time, we might have to wait for next month,” Wu said.\n",
    "Meanwhile, poor air quality was early yesterday recorded in the outlying island counties of Kinmen and Penghu, and parts of western Taiwan due to pollutants from China and stagnant winds, the Environmental Protection Administration said.\n",
    "At 9am, 20 air monitoring stations in areas north of Hsinchu County and in Penghu and Kinmen detected generally unhealthy air quality at the “red alert” level, the agency said.\n",

    "The Ministry of Economic Affairs is to tighten water restrictions to prevent Taiwan from running out of water before the rainy season starts next month, the ministry said yesterday.\n",
    "Hsinchu County remains on “orange alert,” although industrial users that consume more than 1,000m2 of water per day have been asked to reduce consumption by 13 percent, up from the previously required 11 percent, it said, adding that Kaohsiung and Tainan industrial users would have to reduce consumption by 11 percent, up from 7 percent.\n",
    "Non-industrial large water users would have to reduce water consumption by 20 percent, up from 10 percent, it added.\n",
    "In Taoyuan, water pressure for households is to be reduced all day, in extension to the current nighttime reduction.\n",
    "“As the water shortage extends, there are only three things we can do: conserve, reallocate and find new sources of water,” Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Mei-hua (王美花) told reporters at the Central Emergency Operation Center dedicated to the nation’s water situation.\n",
    "Taichung and Miaoli County, which face the strongest effects of the shortage, are on “red alert,” and water supply in the area is switched off on two days per week.\n",
    "The measure has helped save about 15 percent of water, Wang said.\n",
    "The alert level in Hsinchu would not be upgraded to red, she said, adding that no water outages were planned.\n",
    "Pipelines supplying water from less affected regions have been instrumental in mitigating the situation, Wang said.\n",
    "“The Taoyuan-Hsinchu pipeline is delivering 225,000 tonnes of water per day, with 10,000 of that going on to Miaoli,” Wang said. “A further 100,000 tonnes a day are delivered from Yunlin County to Chiayi County, and 50,000 tonnes are delivered from Tainan to Kaohsiung.”\n",
    "New wells are also being drilled at a breakneck pace, with all available CPC Corp, Taiwan (台灣中油) engineers being employed by the ministry, she said.\n",
    "“At two sites near Taichung, engineers struck ground water,” Wang said. “We are expediting the installation of filters and the certification of the well.”\n",
    "The two wells might provide up to 48,000 tonnes per day, enough for 200,000 people, she added.\n",
    "Nationwide, 88 emergency wells would be dug, adding to the 25 existing emergency wells, she said.\n",
    "The wells would provide up to 115,000 tonnes as early as at the end of this month, enough to supply 500,000 people, she added\n",
    "Engineers are drilling three wells in Miaoli County’s Liyutan (鯉魚潭), which would provide 15,000 tonnes per day, she said.\n",
    "“We compressed months of work into weeks to find new water resources,” Wang said.\n",
    "Asked whether the water level at the Shimen Reservoir (石門水庫), which supplies the Taoyuan-Hsinchu pipeline, might fall to below 30 percent, Wang said that the level is above expectations.\n",
    "“In February and March, we were expecting the level to be lower than it is now,” Wang said. “We are trying to find alternate sources to make sure that the level remains as high as possible.”\n",

    "Progress made moving a container ship blocking the Suez Canal should allow some traffic to resume today, while Evergreen Marine Corp (長榮海運) said that it leased the vessel, but would refuse to pay if it remained stuck.\n",
    "The MV Ever Given — a so-called “megaship” at 220,000 tonnes and 400m long — which ran aground in the southern part of the canal in Egypt, had been partially moved and is alongside the bank, said Ahmed Mekawy, deputy manager of the Suez Canal for GAC Group, a provider of port-agent services.\n",
    "The vessel was soon expected to be refloated, Mekawy said, adding that the Suez Canal Authority would then work on resuming transit for all waiting ships.\n",
    "The canal authority had yet to comment on whether the vessel had been moved.\n",
    "Evergreen, which chartered Ever Given from Luster Maritime SA, was notified by the ship owner that the vessel deviated from its course due to suspected sudden strong wind and ran aground 6 nautical miles (11km) south of the estuary at 8am on Tuesday, it said in a statement yesterday.\n",
    "Evergreen urged the ship owner to report the cause of the incident and set up a plan with the authorities to get the vessel out of trouble as soon as possible, it said.\n",
    "Evergreen said that it rented the vessel under a time charter arrangement to add cargo capacity to its operations from East Asia to Europe, while the crew was appointed by the ship owner.\n",
    "“We rent the vessel and decide which seaports it will go to for our sea cargo business. If the Ever Given is still aground and cannot operate normally, we will not pay the rent,” a company official told the Taipei Times by telephone.\n",
    "Whether Evergreen would seek compensation from the ship owner would depend on the cause of the incident, and it would make the decision after an investigation is completed, it added.\n",
    "Luster Maritime, which is headquartered in Panama and a unit of Japan’s Shoei Kisen Kaisha Ltd, provides sea freight transportation services.\n",
    "The incident left dozens of ships gridlocked as they attempted to transit between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean.\n",
    "Efforts to free the ship had so far proceeded faster than initial warnings that traffic could be choked off for days.\n",
    "The 193km-long Suez Canal is among the most trafficked waterways in the world, used by tankers shipping crude from the Middle East to Europe and North America.\n",
    "About 12 percent of global trade and 8 percent of liquefied natural gas pass through the canal, as do about 1 million barrels of oil per day.\n",
    "The Ever Given was grounded early on Tuesday amid poor visibility caused by a dust storm and wind speeds that reached 40 knots, resulting in a “loss of the ability to steer the ship,” the canal authority said.\n",
    "About 42 vessels either in the northbound convoy or arriving to transit the canal in that direction were waiting for the Ever Given to be refloated, Leth Agencies, one of the top providers of Suez Canal crossing services, said in a notice to clients.\n",
    "The company said that it was sending a dredger to help free the ship.\n",
    "About 64 vessels traveling southbound were also affected.\n",

    "The page’s banner was a photograph of Ko on Jade Mountain’s (玉山) main peak.\n",

    "The total number of China Airlines (CAL, 華航) cargo pilots diagnosed with COVID-19 rose to nine yesterday, after the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) said two more pilots were confirmed with the virus.\n",
    "The center has not identified a link among the nine cases or a clear sign of a transmission chain among the airline’s pilots, given the tests results so far and that the nine pilots are from four different fleets, said Minister of Health and Welfare Chen Shih-chung (陳時中), who heads the center.\n",
    "The sources of infection might be better understood after analyzing the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antibody test results of all CAL pilots, Chen said.\n",
    "The center has asked the airline to provide surveillance footage from the overseas hotels where the infected pilots stayed during their layovers.\n",
    "Special police and healthcare experts from centralized quarantine centers would also be dispatched to the airline’s quarantine facility in Taiwan to help determine whether disease prevention measures at the facility are adequate, he said.\n",
    "Before yesterday, the center had reported seven confirmed cases of COVID-19 in CAL cargo pilots in as many days, including an Indonesian pilot who tested positive in Australia.\n",
    "The center had launched an expanded testing program to screen all 1,272 of CAL’s pilots.\n",
    "One of the two new cases — No. 1,102 — is a Taiwanese man who flew to the US on April 6 and returned on April 9, Chen said, adding that he tested negative on April 14 after completing quarantine in Taiwan.\n",
    "He flew on another trip to the US from Monday and Thursday last week.\n",
    "He developed a cough and a fever on Saturday, and tested positive on Sunday with a high viral load, indicating a recent infection, he said.\n",
    "Chen said the other new case — No. 1,105 — is a Taiwanese man who flew to the US on April 8 and returned on April 10.\n",
    "He tested negative upon completing quarantine in Taiwan on April 15, Chen said.\n",
    "He was tested again on Sunday in the expanded testing program and the result came back positive, he said.\n",
    "The pilot said he lost his appetite on Monday last week, he added.\n",
    "The sources of infection are being investigated, Chen said.\n",
    "Although case No. 1,102 attended a public event in Taiwan on April 16, the center believes that the risk of him infecting others at the event is low, because he had tested negative on April 14, Chen said.\n",
    "People with COVID-19 usually become contagious three days before symptoms begin, and as the pilot developed symptoms on Saturday, he is more likely to have been in the US or under quarantine in Taiwan when he was contagious, Chen said.\n",
    "The CECC also reported two new imported cases — a Burmese man and a Chinese man who are crew members on the same ship.\n",
    "Separately yesterday, reporters asked whether inbound travelers who have received the full dosage of a COVID-19 vaccine in another country would be exempt from quarantine upon arrival.\n",
    "Chen said a trial program, which is in its final approval process, would soon be launched.\n",
    "The center might allow a limited number of people who have been vaccinated for at least a month to apply for a reduced quarantine period of seven days, starting in the middle of next month, he said.\n",
    "The vaccines would need to be complemented with a negative PCR test result obtained before arriving in Taiwan, an antibody test taken upon arrival and another negative PCR test result on the last day of quarantine, he said.\n",
    "The center on April 14 announced that crew members from Taiwanese airlines who have been vaccinated for at least two weeks would be exempt from mandatory home quarantine after returning to the nation, and would only have to perform seven days of self-health management after a long-haul flight.'''\n",

    "This mission, dubbed Crew-2, marks the third-ever crewed flight for Elon Musk's company and the first to make use of a previously flown, privately-owned rocket booster and spacecraft.\n",
    "The astronauts took off from Kennedy Space Center in Florida Friday morning and spent nearly 24 hours soaring through orbit at more than 17,000 miles per hour, as their Crew Dragon spacecraft maneuvered toward the ISS, which orbits about 250 miles above Earth.\n",
    "On Saturday morning, the capsule slowly aligned itself and moved in to dock directly with one of the space station's ports.\n",
    "The crew consists of NASA astronauts Shane Kimbrough and Megan McArthur, Thomas Pesquet of the European Space Agency, and Akihiko Hoshide with Japan's JAXA space agency.\n",
    "A prime focus of the astronauts' mission will be research with \"tissue chips,\" or \"small models of human organs containing multiple cell types that behave much the same as they do in the body\" and that NASA hopes will advance the development of drugs and vaccines, according to the space agency. That work will build on years of studying biological and other scientific phenomena aboard the ISS, where the microgravity environment can give scientists a better fundamental understanding of how something works.\n",
    "Kimbrough, McArthur, Pesquet, and Hoshide joined seven astronauts already on board the station, four of whom arrived on a different SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule in November. That brings the space station's current total of personnel to 11 — one of the largest crews the ISS has ever hosted. But that number will quickly drop back down to seven when four of the astronauts who'd been on board hitch a ride home from the station on April 28.\n",
    "NASA has spent more than a decade working to boost staffing aboard the 21-year-old space station after the retirement of its Space Shuttle program in 2011 left Russia's Soyuz spacecraft as the only option for getting astronauts to and from the ISS. The United States had been paying Russia as much as $90 million per seat for those trips.\n",
    "For years, SpaceX worked under a $2.6 billion fixed-price contract to develop its Crew Dragon spacecraft under NASA's Commercial Crew program, which for the first time in the space agency's history handed over the task of building and testing a crew-worthy spacecraft to the private sector.\n",
    "(Boeing (BA) is working under a similar contract to develop its own capsule for the program. That capsule, called Starliner, is still in the testing phase.)\n",
    "The mission is a hallmark in SpaceX's efforts to reuse spacefaring hardware in order to drive down the cost of spaceflight. Both the Crew Dragon capsule, named \"Endeavour,\" and the Falcon 9 rocket that lofted it into orbit have flown in space before.\n",
    "Though the company has re-flown boosters and spacecraft dozens of times on satellite and cargo launches over the past several years, this marks the first time the company has reused hardware for a crewed mission.\n",
